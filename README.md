# Course Notes for STAT230 at UWaterloo

Notes taken throughout the term, put into a consistent and understandable
format. Made for anyone to use freely.

>This work was heavily influenced by the official STAT230 Course Notes for
Winter 2017 and the online lectures of the course provided in the Winter
2017 term.

This is currently an incomplete project and will be updated frequently until
the full scope of the course (or most of it) is covered.
